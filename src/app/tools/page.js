    name: "Digital Multimeter",
    Icon: Gauge,
    summary:
      "A multimeter measures voltage, current and resistance in a circuit. It's the first tool every electronics hobbyist reaches for — use it to check if a battery is alive, find a short circuit, or verify a component's resistance before soldering it in.",
  },
  {
    name: "Soldering Iron",
    Icon: Flame,
    summary:
      "Used to melt solder and join electronic components to a PCB or wire. A temperature-controlled iron (around 350°C for lead-free solder) gives cleaner joints and protects sensitive components from heat damage.",
  },
  {
    name: "Wire Stripper / Cutter",
    Icon: Scissors,
    summary:
      "Strips the plastic insulation off wires without nicking the copper strands inside, and cuts wire to length. Essential for clean, reliable connections in any wiring or breadboard project.",
  },
  {
    name: "Screwdriver Set",
    Icon: Wrench,
    summary:
      "A precision set (Phillips, flathead, Torx) for opening enclosures, mounting PCBs, and assembling robot chassis. Magnetic tips help with small screws that are easy to drop.",
  },
  {
    name: "Breadboard",
    Icon: Grid3x3,
    summary:
      "A reusable prototyping board with a grid of connected holes — lets you build and test circuits without soldering. Perfect for trying out a circuit before making it permanent.",
  },
  {
    name: "Jumper Wires",
    Icon: Cable,
    summary:
      "Pre-cut wires with connector pins on each end (male-to-male, male-to-female, female-to-female) used to connect components on a breadboard or to a microcontroller like Arduino.",
  },
  {
    name: "Hot Glue Gun",
    Icon: Droplet,
    summary:
      "Melts solid glue sticks for quick, strong bonding of plastic, wood and most robot-build materials. Great for securing wires, mounting sensors, or fixing a chassis together fast.",
  },
  {
    name: "Wire Crimping Tool",
    Icon: Pin,
    summary:
      "Attaches connectors (like Dupont or JST pins) onto the end of a wire by compressing metal terminals around it — gives a much more reliable connection than soldering for removable connectors.",
  },
  {
    name: "Precision Tweezers",
    Icon: Pin,
    summary:
      "Used to hold and place small SMD components, adjust jumpers, or handle tiny screws and parts that are too small to manage with your fingers.",
  },
  {
    name: "Heat Gun",
    Icon: Wind,
    summary:
      "Shrinks heat-shrink tubing over wire joints for insulation and a clean finish. Also used to gently desolder components or remove adhesive labels without scratching surfaces.",
  },
  {
    name: "PCB Vice / Helping Hands",
    Icon: HandMetal,
    summary:
      "A stand with adjustable arms and alligator clips (often with a magnifying glass) that holds your PCB or wires steady while you solder, freeing up both your hands.",
  },
  {
    name: "Anti-Static Wrist Strap",
    Icon: Zap,
    summary:
      "Grounds your body to prevent static discharge while handling sensitive components like microcontrollers, ICs and memory modules — a single static spark can silently kill a chip.",
  },
